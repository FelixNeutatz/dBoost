TODO
====

## Research

* Closer look at references [R] [PAPER]
* Comparison to other datasets from the COORDS (Census DB, TPCH) [Z] [PAPER]
* Test outlier analysis on subset of intel dataset where elements aren't correlated (further analysis of intel dataset) [Z]
* Mixed discrete/continuous models, e.g. different distributions based on value of one field (i.e. report all (low cardinality, high cardinality) columns as correlated) [C/R]

## Code

* Make the plots more reproducible (integrate in the Makefile) [R]
* Add a clean target to the Makefile

## Paper

* Change title?
* The work preprocessor designates a statistical analyzer in the code and the tuple expander in the paper
* Git email and usernames

LATER
=====

## Code

* Properly support multiple models
  - Train all models in one pass (instead of one per model) [C] [LATER]
  - Combine outlier reports from multiple models
* Adjust Gaussian model to use data from statistical analysis [C] [LATER]
* Add unit tests [Z, LATER]
* Look at correlations inside the expansion of a given field [LATER] [EASY]
* Ensure that there is only one type per column [LATER]
* Change the outlier reporting strategy to make it easier to report outliers [LATER]

## Research

* Think about asymmetric features (like email addresses: we don't want to detect things that do not have '@' signs)

DONE
====

## Research

* Create synthetic data set; suggest as new benchmarks in case of non numerical data [C] [DONE?] [PAPER]

## Code

* New features: floats to dates & times, ... [C/R] [DONE C]
* Add cardinality to preprocessor [R] [DONE]
* Create a list of examples [C] [DONE]
* New features: email validation [C] [DONE]
* Histogram-based correlations [C] [DONE, PAPER]
* Check correlation detection on the Intel dataset [R/C] [DONE C]
* Artificial datasets for testing [C] [DONE?]
