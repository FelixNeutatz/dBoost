## Research

* Closer look at references [R] [ONGOING] [PAPER]
* Add stuff to related work section [Z]
* Find a good continuous multi-dimensional dataset [Z]
* Comparison to other datasets from the COORDS (Census DB, TPCH) [Z] [PAPER]
* Test outlier analysis on subset of intel dataset where elements aren't correlated (further analysis of intel dataset) [Z]

## Code

* Add csail examples to invocation.md [C]
* Make the plots more reproducible (integrate in the Makefile) [R]
* Add a clean target to the Makefile [R]
* Optimize the statistical preprocessor [C] [DONE]
  - TPCH [Z]
* Pass the output of the preprocessor to models [C]
  - Make CORDS a model [R]

## Paper

* Change title? [LATER]
* Add missing stuff
  - Outlier detection description for mixture models [Z]
  - Update Intel graphs [R]
  - Peaky histograms [C]
  - Partitioning functor [C]
  - Discrete preprocessor [C]
  - Synthetic datasets [C]
  - Review the history to find new stuff [C]
* At the beginning of evaluation, add a high-level overview of all the datasets [LATER]
* Change the names in CSAIL [R]
* Numerical benchmarks in the evaluation section [LATER]
* The word "preprocessor" designates a statistical analyzer in the code and the tuple expander in the paper [C]

LATER
=====

## Research

* Mixed discrete/continuous models, e.g. different distributions based on value of one field (i.e. report all (low cardinality, high cardinality) columns as correlated) [C/R]
* Think about asymmetric features (like email addresses: we don't want to detect things that do not have '@' signs)

## Code

* Properly support multiple models
  - Train all models in one pass (instead of one per model) [C] [LATER]
  - Combine outlier reports from multiple models
* Adjust Gaussian model to use data from statistical analysis [C] [LATER]
* Add unit tests [Z, LATER]
* Look at correlations inside the expansion of a given field [LATER] [EASY]
* Ensure that there is only one type per column [LATER]
* Change the outlier reporting strategy to make it easier to report outliers [LATER]
  - Use `namedtuples`
