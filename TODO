* TODO

** Research

- [ ] R PAPER Closer look at references
- [X] Z Add stuff to related work section
- [X] Z Find a good continuous multi-dimensional dataset
- [ ] Z Comparison to other datasets from the COORDS (Census DB, TPCH)
- [ ] Z Test outlier analysis on subset of intel dataset where elements aren't correlated (further analysis of intel dataset)

** Code

- [X] C Add csail examples to invocation.md
- [X] R Make the plots more reproducible (integrate in the Makefile)
- [X] R Add a clean target to the Makefile
- [-] Optimize the statistical analyzer
  - [X] C Look at performance
  - [ ] Z Test TPCH
- [X] C Pass the output of the analyzer to models
- [X] R Make CORDS a model
- [X] C Check PyPy compatibility

** Paper

- [ ] ? Change title?
- [-] Add missing stuff
  - [X] Z Outlier detection description for mixture models
  - [ ] R Update Intel graphs
  - [X] C Peaky histograms
  - [X] C Partitioning functor
  - [X] C Discrete analyzer
  - [X] C Synthetic datasets
  - [ ] C Review the history to find new stuff
- [X] C At the beginning of evaluation, add a high-level overview of all the datasets
- [X] R Change the names in CSAIL
- [ ] ? Numerical benchmarks in the evaluation section
- [X] C The word "preprocessor" designates a statistical analyzer in the code
  and the tuple expander in the paper


* LATER

** Research

- [ ] C/R Mixed discrete/continuous models, e.g. different distributions based on value of one field (i.e. report all (low cardinality, high cardinality) columns as correlated)
- [ ] Think about asymmetric features (like email addresses: we don't want to detect things that do not have '@' signs)

** Code

- [ ] ? Properly support multiple models
  - [ ] C Train all models in one pass (instead of one per model)
- [ ] ? Combine outlier reports from multiple models
- [X] C Adjust Gaussian model to use data from statistical analysis
- [ ] Z Add unit tests
- [ ] ? Look at correlations inside the expansion of a given field
- [ ] ? Ensure that there is only one type per column
- [ ] ? Change the outlier reporting strategy to make it easier to report
  outliers
  - [ ] C Use =namedtuple=s


* DONE

** Research

- [X] C Create synthetic data set; suggest as new benchmarks in case of non numerical data
- [X] Z Mixture model thresholds
- [X] A Identifying other outlier detection strategies / correlation detection strategies

** Code

- [X] C New features: floats to dates & times, ...
- [X] R Add cardinality to analyzer
- [X] C Create a list of examples
- [X] C New features: email validation
- [X] C Histogram-based correlations
- [X] C Check correlation detection on the Intel dataset
- [X] C Artificial datasets for testing
- [X] C Git email and usernames
