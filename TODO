# TODO

-   Research:
    *   Closer look at references [R] [PAPER]
    *   Comparison to other datasets from the COORDS (Census DB, TPCH) [Z] [PAPER]
    *   Create synthetic data set; suggest as new benchmarks in case of non numerical data [C, PARTIALLY DONE] [PAPER]
    *   Test outlier analysis on subset of intel dataset where elements aren't correlated (further analysis of intel dataset) [Z]
    *   Mixed discrete/continuous models, e.g. different distributions based on value of one field (i.e. report all (low cardinality, high cardinality) columns as correlated) [C]

    *   Think about asymmetric features (like email addresses: we don't want to detect things that do not have '@' signs)
    *   Identifying other outlier detection strategies / correlation detection strategies

-   Code:
    *   Artificial datasets for testing [C, PARTIALLY DONE]
    *   Check correlation detection on the Intel dataset [R/C]
    *   Make the plots more reproducible (integrate in the Makefile) [R]
    *   New features: strings & floats to dates & times, ... [C/R]
    *   Train all models in one pass (instead of one per model) [C, LATER]
    *   Adjust Gaussian to use data from statistical analysis [C, LATER]
    *   Unit tests [Z, LATER]
    *   Look at correlations inside the expansion of a given field [LATER]
    *   Ensure that there is only one type per column [LATER]
    *   Change the outlier reporting strategy to make it easier to report outliers [LATER]

# Done

-   Research:
    *   Histogram-based correlations [C] [DONE, PAPER]
    *   Mixture model thresholds [Z] [KINDA DONE, PAPER]

-   Code:
    *   Create a list of examples [C, DONE]
    *   New features: email validation [C] [DONE]
    *   Add cardinality to preprocessor [R] [DONE]
