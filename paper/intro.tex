% INTRODUCTION

%Detecting outliers is an important problem in detecting inconsistencies within a data set.
Sensor measurement errors, abnormal stock market fluctuations, credit card fraud, and human input error all result in outliers.
Formally, an outlier is defined by Hawkins as “an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism” \cite{Hawkins1980}.


In this work, we draw on some of the ideas from existing literature on outlier detection and statistical and probabilistic methods to detect data inconsistencies.
Our system learns how normal data behaves.
By applying this information to the rest of the data, our system can detect outlying data.
Given a small data sample for static analysis, the system can determine outliers from new data added to databases in real time.

In summary, our contributions are as follows:
\begin{enumerate}
\item We present a framework that detects data outliers.
\item We apply machine learning techniques to model data behavior.
\item We evaluate our framework on several real-world datasets.
\end{enumerate}
