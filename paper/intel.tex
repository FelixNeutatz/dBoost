% INTEL LAB DATA

We evaluated our outlier detection models on some sensor data from the publicly available Intel Lab Data set \cite{IntelLabData}.
The Intel Lab Data contains data collected from 54 sensors spread throughout the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.ho
Each data entry is timestamped and contains information including humidity, temperature, light and voltage taken from a Micro2dot sensor and weatherboard.

This data set has known outliers from faulty sensor readings due to periods of critically low voltage.
