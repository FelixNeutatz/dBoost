% INTEL LAB DATA

We evaluated our outlier detection framework on sensor data from the publicly available Intel Lab Data set \cite{IntelLabData}.
The Intel Lab Data contains data collected from 54 sensors spread throughout the Intel Berkeley Research Lab.
Each data entry is timestamped and contains information including humidity, temperature, light and voltage taken from a Micro2dot sensor and weatherboard.
The dataset includes approximately 2.3 million entries, but in our experiments we drew from a random sample of the rows.

This data set has known outliers from faulty sensor readings due to periods of critically low voltage.
Most notably, sensor 15 fails and
