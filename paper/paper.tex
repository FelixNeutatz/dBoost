% ****************** AUTHORS **************************************

% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

% You can go ahead and credit any number of authors here,
% e.g. one 'row of three' or two rows (consisting of one row of three
% and a second row of one, two or three).
%
% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and
% e-mail address. Additionally, tag each line of
% affiliation/address with \affaddr, and tag the
% e-mail address with \email.

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
Rapidly developing areas of information technology are generating massive amounts of data. Human errors, sensor failures, and other unforeseen circumstances unfortunately tend to undermine the quality and the consistency of these datasets by causing the apparition of outliers -- data points that exhibit surprising behavior when compared to the rest of the data. Characterizing, locating, and in some cases eliminating these outliers offers interesting insight about the data under scrutiny and reinforces the confidence that one may have in conclusions drawn from otherwise noisy datasets.

We report on the design and development of a new user-guided outlier detection framework, dBoost, which relies on inference and statistical modeling of heterogeneous data to flag suspicious fields in database tuples. At the heart of the system lies a tuple expansion procedure, which reconstructs rich information from semantically poor SQL data types such as strings, integers, and floating point numbers. We show that this novel approach achieves good classification performance, both in traditional numerical datasets and in highly non-numerical contexts such as mostly textual datasets. Our implementation is publicly available, under version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
