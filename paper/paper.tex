% You need the command \numberofauthors to handle the 'placement
% and alignment' of the authors beneath the title.
%
% For aesthetic reasons, we recommend 'three authors at a time'
% i.e. three 'name/affiliation blocks' be placed beneath the title.
%
% NOTE: You are NOT restricted in how many 'rows' of
% "name/affiliations" may appear. We just ask that you restrict
% the number of 'columns' to three.
%
% Because of the available 'opening page real-estate'
% we ask you to refrain from putting more than six authors
% (two rows with three columns) beneath the article title.
% More than six makes the first-page appear very cluttered indeed.
%
% Use the \alignauthor commands to handle the names
% and affiliations for an 'aesthetic maximum' of six authors.
% Add names, affiliations, addresses for
% the seventh etc. author(s) as the argument for the
% \additionalauthors command.
% These 'additional authors' will be output/set for you
% without further effort on your part as the last section in
% the body of your article BEFORE References or any Appendices.

\numberofauthors{3} %  in this sample file, there are a *total*
% of EIGHT authors. SIX appear on the 'first-page' (for formatting

% and a second row of one, two or three).

% The command \alignauthor (no curly braces needed) should
% precede each author name, affiliation/snail-mail address and

\begin{abstract}
Databases are prone to input errors such as by human users or faulty sensors.
Automatic detection of outliers in the input data would allow these errors to be detected and database administrators to be notified when input data does not fit the typical data set.
In this project, we will build a tool to facilitate the automatic detection of outliers.
\end{abstract}




\section{Introduction}
Detecting outliers is an important problem in detecting inconsistencies within a data set.
Applications include detecting measurement errors from sensors, abnormal fluctuations in the stock market, credit card fraud, and incorrect human input such as typos or misreadings.
Formally, an outlier is defined by Hawkins as “an observation which deviates so much from the other observations as to arouse suspicions that it was generated by a different mechanism.” \cite{Hawkins1980}.
There has been substantial research in how to build models to detect outliers \cite{Aggarwal2013}, including how to detect outliers in high­dimensional data by searching the subspaces of the dat \cite{Zhang2004}\cite{Kriegel2009}.
However many of these algorithms are complex and can require substantial computation to determine whether a new data point lies outside the data.

Statistical methods have been used to detect functional dependencies between columns of relational databases for the purpose of informing the query optimizer of potential data dependencies \cite{Ilyas2004} 
These methods require only a small sample of the data to detect functional dependencies with high probability of correctness.
The relatively low computation required by these algorithms makes them more amenable to detecting data anomalies in real time.

During our class project, we will draw on some of the ideas from the existing outlier detection literature and statistical methods to detect data inconsistencies on databases that are updated in real time.
We will build and evaluate a tool that automatically detects outliers based on dependencies between the data.
