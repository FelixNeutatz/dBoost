\subsubsection{Tuple Expansion}
We expand tuples in order to harness isolated information about the data that may not be easy to see when looking at the data in its original form.
For example, the day of the week may be relevant information from a date, but unless the database stores this information in a separate column, the information is lost on most analyzers.
In order to capture this kind of information, we break down tuples into a series of sub-tuples based on the type of each column along with the original value.
We determined these breakdowns based on our own intuition and the datasets we worked with.

\begin{itemize}
\item Strings
\begin{itemize}
\item Case: All upper or lower case, or title case.
\item Digits: Are there digits in the string?
\item Length: The length of the string in characters.
\end{itemize}
\item Dates
\begin{itemize}
\item Year, month, day
\item Hour, minute, seconds
\item Day of the week
\end{itemize}
\item Integers
\begin{itemize}
\item Bit position: What bits are activated?
\item Modulo: What is the value modulo some other value?
\end{itemize}
\item Floating Point
\begin{itemize}
\item Length: What is the significance of the number?
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}
