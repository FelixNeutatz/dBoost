We built a tool that analyzes datasets for outliers.
The tool is a three-pass process with the following stages:
\begin{enumerate}
%\item Tuple Expansion -- Tuples are expanded based on type.
\item Preprocessing -- Statistics are collected on data which can be used in future pipeline stages. The preprocessor also determines whether columns of expanded tuples are correlated.
\item Model Creation -- We use a variety of probabilistic models. 
\item Outlier Detection -- Using the models built on the existing dataset, we can detect outliers outside of specified parameters.
\end{enumerate}
