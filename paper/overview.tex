We designed a framework that analyzes, models, and detects outliers in data.
The whole system can be seen in Figure~\ref{fig:pipeline}.

As a first step, tuples are read from the database and expanded: a set of type-dependent features is extracted for each field. These features express important properties of the data, such as the length of a string, or the parity of an integer.

These expanded tuples are then analyzed in order to obtain simple statistical information (mean, variance), and to detect correlations between the different fields. Next, the expanded tuples as well as the correlation information are passed to one of three data model generators, which return a model of the data.

Finally, this model is used to determine whether or not new tuples fall outside the learned data distribution. Although we mostly used the data models to detect outliers in the tuples used to learn the model parameters, the models can also be used to analyze new inputs.

From a high level view, our pipeline is implemented as a three-pass streaming algorithm, requiring no memory beyond that required to train the individual models.

The different stages of our pipeline are summarized as follows and described in detail in the following sections:

\begin{enumerate}
	\item Preprocessing -- During this phase, tuples are expanded using knowledge about the database schema and field types. This process is described in detail in Section~\ref{sec:preproc}.

	\item Statistical analysis -- During this stage, we collect statistics on the expanded data. These statistics are used during data modeling and outlier detection. During this analysis, information about linear correlations between expanded tuples are also gathered for the data modeling phase. This process is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:stat_anal}.
 
	\item Data modeling -- We apply several machine-learning algorithms to build models of the data. We describe this phase in Section~\ref{sec:model_creation}

	\item Outlier detection -- Using the models built in the previous stage, the outlier detector identifies data that lies outside of specified parameters. This process is detailed in Section~\ref{sec:outlier_detection}.
\end{enumerate}
