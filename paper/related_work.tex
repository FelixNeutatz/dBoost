% Outlier Detection
There has been substantial research in how to build models to detect outliers \cite{Aggarwal2013}, including how to detect outliers in highÂ­dimensional data by searching the subspaces of the dat \cite{Zhang2004}\cite{Kriegel2009}.
However many of these algorithms are complex and can require substantial computation to determine whether a new data point lies outside the data.

% Outlier Detection Visualization
Additional research has been done to try to summarize outliers in data visualization techniques \cite{Wu}.

% Statistical methods
Statistical methods have been used to detect functional dependencies between columns of relational databases for the purpose of informing the query optimizer of potential data dependencies \cite{Ilyas2004} 
These methods require only a small sample of the data to detect functional dependencies with high probability of correctness.
The relatively low computation required by these algorithms makes them more amenable to detecting data anomalies in real time.
