% FUTURE WORK

Our framework can easily be applied to real time data processing.
After analyzing a small test set, which could be generated using random sampling of existing data, statistics and model parameters can be saved and used to detect outliers from individual tuples as they are added to the database.
Thus, at run time, only the outlier detection phase from section~\ref{sec:outlier_detection} must be executed, which adds minimum overhead and allows throughput.
We leave designing a user interface for database administrators and/or users for future work.

We would also like to expand our framework to include more statistical and probabilistic models. Our statistical analyzer currently only detects linear correlations on numerical data.
By implementing more sophisticated algorithms, we may be able to find non-linear correlations and include non-numerical data in our analysis.
