% CONCLUSION

In this paper we presented dBoost, a toolkit that leverages tuple expansion to detect outliers in both numerical and heterogeneous data sets. We demonstrated that well-known artificial intelligence strategies could be used to flag spurious numerical and to a lesser extent non-numerical data. We demonstrated that simple correlation modeling was useful in inferring data dependencies and improving the accuracy of outlier detection procedures. We discussed histogram-based models, and showed that they provided a useful tool in analysing mostly textual data.

We showed that our toolkit performs well on real-world problems, including identifying potentially wrong entries in a people directory and flagging erroneous values generated by faulty sensors. Our toolkit and its source code are available for public use under a permissive license, with the hope of allowing database users to formulate their own type-based rules and find discrepancies in their own data.

We believe that the preliminary results presented in this paper are promising, especially in the area of identifying outliers in heterogeneous data.
