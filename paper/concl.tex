% CONCLUSION

In this paper, we presented dBoost, a toolkit that detects outliers in both real-valued and heterogeneous data sets using three different data modeling techniques.

We demonstrated how the tool performs on real-world problems, including identifying potential wrong entries in a directory and flagging erroneous values generated by faulty sensors.
This toolkit is available for public use to allow developers to formulate their own type-based rules and find discrepancies in their own data.

We believe that the preliminary results presented in this paper are promising, especially in the area of identifying outliers in heterogeneous data.
