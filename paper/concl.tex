% CONCLUSION

In this work, we presented dBoost, a toolkit that detects outliers in both real-valued and heterogeneous data.
We demonstrated how the tool performs on real-world problems, including identifying potential wrong entries in a directory and flagging erroneous values generated by faulty sensors.
This tool is available for public use to allow developers to form their own type-based rules and find discrepancies in their own data.
